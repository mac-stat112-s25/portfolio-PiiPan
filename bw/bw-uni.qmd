---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "orange")  +
  theme_minimal()
```
