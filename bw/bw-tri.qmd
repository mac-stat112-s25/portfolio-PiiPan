Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(education,aes(x=salary,y=expend,color=sat))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    caption = "Source: ICA",
    title = "Relationship between estimated average annual salary of elementary school teacher , expenditure per pupil and the state-level average total SAT score",
    x = "Estimated average annual teacher salary",
    y = "Expenditure per pupil"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
