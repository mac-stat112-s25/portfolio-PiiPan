Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(gplots)
library(rnaturalearth)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
fave_places <- read.csv("https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv")
```

```{r}
leaflet(data = fave_places) |>
  addProviderTiles("USGS") |>
  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex("yellow")) |>
  addPolylines(
    lng = ~longitude,
    lat = ~latitude,
    color = col2hex("green")
  )
```
