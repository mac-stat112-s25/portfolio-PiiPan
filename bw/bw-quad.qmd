Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  
```

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    caption = "Source: ICA",
    title = "Relationship between temperatures at 9AM and at 3Pm for weather data in Australia",
    x = "Temperature at 9AM",
    y = "Temperature at 3PM"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
