Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidymodels)

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  
```

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) +
